Here are three concise, non-obvious bullet-point insights:

*   **Commodity Price Movements:** Beyond simple price listings (e.g., 100 EGP/ton for rice in 1935), the data reveals that commodity markets in mid-1930s Egypt were significantly influenced by non-price factors like persistent quality control issues with imports (e.g., broken rice) and broad "trader worries about imports," indicating deeper supply chain fragilities beyond mere price volatility.
*   **Networks of Persons/Companies:** Rachid Behna's operations highlight a sophisticated, yet often informal, commercial network in 1930s Egypt, balancing formal structures (multi-city offices, telegraphs) with deep personal and possibly familial trust-based relationships (e.g., "My dear brother" in a business context) to manage complex transactions and remittances.
*   **Macroeconomic Context:** The concurrent issues of import dependency (rice, "Bohr") coupled with "trader worries about imports" and the ongoing process of liquidating "Turkish Estates" suggest that the Egyptian economy in the mid-1930s was still deeply shaped by its post-Ottoman transition and the inherent vulnerabilities of an import-reliant structure in a volatile global trade environment.
