The image is significantly faded and difficult to read, but I will do my best to extract and structure any visible content according to your requirements.

---

```json
{
  "Persons": [],
  "Places": [],
  "companies": [],
  "commodities": [],
  "extracted_text": "سجل ديواني\nالامر",
  "language": "ar",
  "Translation_to_English": "Registry Office\nOrder",
  "date": ""
}
```

---

### Notes:
- **extracted_text**: The visible words are in Arabic and say "سجل ديواني" (Registry Office) and "الامر" (the order/command).
- **language**: Arabic.
- **Translation_to_English**: Provided.
- No people, companies, places, or commodities are mentioned, and there is no clear date visible in the image.
- If you have a higher quality or less faded image, more accurate extraction may be possible.
